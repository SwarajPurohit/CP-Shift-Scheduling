# CP-Shift-Scheduling
Constraint optimization problem for shift scheduling solved using python pulp library. Shifts need to be created to meet the demand in Sales.xlsx given the following rules:
● Minimum shift length is 3 hours long  
● Maximum shift length is 8 hours long 
● There are 4 employees at this location, and assume for simplicity that all of them are equal  and can do all functions at Coffee Coffee (take orders, make drinks, etc)  
● Opening hours are 6am to 4pm every day 

Future Work:
● Incorporate breaks
● Incorporate employee availability and wage difference.
